## Summary

This is a Vue 3 and TypeScript frontend application, built with Vite, designed to manage logistics operations for a transport company. It leverages third-party packages, custom code and API clients—while maintaining a clean, scalable codebase. The app uses reusable UI components like selects, radio buttons, and modals, along with centralised config and shared logic for consistency across the project. Secure access control is implemented using vue-router and token-based authentication to manage user permissions. Advanced error handling, validation feedback, and redirect logic ensure a robust and user-friendly experience. The codebase follows clean architecture principles, with structured data mappers, consistent naming conventions, and strong separation of concerns.

## Features

- Implements a Pinia stores to manage application state such as user sessions, permissions, and shared settings in a scalable and reactive way.
- Built to manage logistics workflows for a transport company, including operations like job tracking, scheduling, live pricing, journey time estimations and delivery optimisation.
- Makes extensive use of third-party packages for enhanced functionality such as form validation, date/time selection, and API handling.
- Includes a library of reusable components (e.g. radios, selects, modals, loaders) and shared config files for consistent UI and logic patterns across the app.
- Implements token-based access control using vue-router guards to restrict and manage access based on user roles.
- Features sophisticated error handling, including input validation, permission errors, user feedback, and auto-redirects for blocked or expired sessions.
- Uses clean coding standards with clear separation of frontend/backend logic, data mappers for API communication, and consistent naming conventions.
- Designed for scalability and maintainability, making it easy to extend features or onboard new developers.
